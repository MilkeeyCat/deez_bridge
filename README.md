# DeezBridge

A toy project aimed to make a program which will copy messages from irc channel to discord and vice versa(and maybe with some cool features).
To run this thing you would need to set correct data in `.env` file first and then run command below to build the project

```bash
go build -o main cmd/main.go
```
